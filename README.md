# RawToPrompt 📜➡️❓

RawToPrompt is a project aimed at converting raw, unstructured text data into structured prompt-completion pairs suitable for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). It intelligently ingests raw `.txt` files, processes the content, and generates contextual prompts and completions based on the content using state-of-the-art NLP techniques.

## Project Objective 🎯

To create a data pipeline:

1. **Ingestion**: Accept raw `.txt` files.
2. **Processing**: Clean and preprocess the text data.
3. **Interactive Q/A**: Optionally ask the user for specific prompts or topics.
4. **Prompt Completion Generation**: Generate AI-driven contextual prompts and completions.
